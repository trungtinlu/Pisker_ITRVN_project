* **STM32 Microcontroller**: The project is based on the STM32 microcontroller platform, which offers a wide range of microcontrollers with different performance levels and features.
*  **STM32CubeIDE**: The project was developed using popular IDEs which is STM32CubeIDE, provide tools for code development, debugging, and firmware deployment.
*  **Communication Protocols**: The project includes the implementation of communication protocols such as UART, I2C.
*  **Peripheral Libraries**: The project utilizes peripheral libraries provided by the microcontroller manufacturer or third-party libraries to simplify the integration and configuration of peripherals.
*  **Other Device**: We intergrated a lot of device to increase experiment of customer and performance of device.
*  See our [document](./feature_of_project.md) and [system architecture](./firmware_architechture.png).
