# Pisker clock

![Pisker clock](Device_gif.jpg)

## Purpose

The goal of the Pisker project is to create a convenient and intelligent smart desk clock. Pisker is more than just an ordinary alarm clock; it also functions as a speaker. The clock will feature additional functionalities such as notifications, sound adjustment, and user interaction through an RGB matrix LED and control buttons. Additionally, there will be UI controls for managing the device.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

1. **Time Display**: The device can display the time (hours, minutes, seconds) and date on the screen.

2. **Alarm and Notifications**: The clock can set timers, alarm, countdowns.

3. **Music player**: User can play music via SD card.

4. **Rhythm light**: Device can display sound wave of the music.

5. **Computer Interaction Capability**: User can set the time and alarm via UART for Pisker.
